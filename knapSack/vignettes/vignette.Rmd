## Knapsack package

This package is created to study the effects of algorithms with different computinal complexity. This package contains three different functions for solving **knapsack** problem.


## How to install and load

### Install 

To install the package [devtools] in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), you can just run the following command
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```


After the installation of `devtools`, we can simply run the following command in the RStudio console
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github(repo = "thiph169/ARP-lab-6/", 
                         build_vignette = TRUE)
```

### Load

After the installation is successful, we want to load the package using

```{r}
library(knapSack)
```


## Knapsack

The first step is to create a list of items with values and weights.  

```{r}
set.seed(42)
n <- 2000
knapsack_objects <-
data.frame(
w=sample(1:4000, size = n, replace = TRUE),
v=runif(n = n, 0, 10000)
)
```

This can then be used within the other functions.


##Brute Force search

The `brute_force_knapsack` function analyzes every possible combination and therefore always returns the maximum possible value for the knapsack. 

The `brute_force_knapsack` function is used by inputting the list of objects and the total weight the knapsack can carry. It can be seen in the following example:

```{r}
brute_force_knapsack(x = knapsack_objects[1:8,], W = 3500)
```


##Dynamic Programming

The `dynamic_knapsack` assumes discrete values for the item weights. It iterates over all possible values of \code{w} (weight). It returns the same results as `knapsack_brute_force` but is more efficient.

The `dynamic_knapsack` function is used by inputting the list of objects and the total weight the knapsack can carry. It can be seen in the following example:

```{r}

knapsack_dynamic(x = knapsack_objects[1:8,], W = 3500)
```


##Greedy Heuristic

The `greedy_knapsack` function uses an approximation that will not necessarily give the exact result, but will drastically reduce the processing time and load as compared to the previous methods.

The `greedy_knapsack` function is used by inputting the list of objects and the total weight the knapsack can carry. It can be seen in the following example:

```{r}
greedy_knapsack(x = knapsack_objects[1:800,], W = 3500)
```
